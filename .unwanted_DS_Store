1. Click on the image link at GitHub to verify that the git push succeeded.

Answer : its succeded.

2. At this point, the number of commits is large enough that the output of git log -p is probably too big to fit in your terminal window. Con­ firm that running git log -p drops you into a less interface for easier navigation.

3. Use your knowledge of less commands to search for the commit that added the HTML DOCTYPE. What is the SHA of the commit?

3.2.1

1. Commit the .gitignore file to your repository. Hint: Running git commit -am isn’t enough. Why not?

Answer : .gitignore commited to the repository.

Only git commit -am is not enough, as there is m switch, we also mention the commit text with it.

2. Push your commit up to GitHub and confirm using the web interface that the push succeeded.

Answer : Push succeded.

3. Check out test-branch and use touch to add a file with a name of your choice, then add and commit it to the repository.

 * [new branch]      test-branch -> test-branch

4. Check out the main branch and try deleting the test branch using git branch -d to confirm that it doesn’t work. The reason is that, in con­ trast to the about-page branch, the test branch hasn’t been merged into main, and by design -d doesn’t work in this case. Because we don’t actually want its changes, delete the test by using the related -D option, which deletes the branch in question even if its changes are unmerged.

$ git branch -d test-branch
error: the branch 'test-branch' is not fully merged
hint: If you are sure you want to delete it, run 'git branch -D test-branch'
hint: Disable this message with "git config advice.forceDeleteBranch false"

3.4.1

The git checkout -f trick works only with files that are staged for commit or are already part of the repository, but sometimes you want to get rid of new files as well. Using touch, create a file with a name of your choice, then git add it. Verify that running git checkout -f gets rid of it.
2. Like many other Unix programs, git accepts both “short form” and “long form” options. Repeat the previous exercise with git checkout --force to confirm that the effects of -f and --force are identical. Extra credit: Double­check this conclusion by finding the “force” option in the output of git help checkout.
